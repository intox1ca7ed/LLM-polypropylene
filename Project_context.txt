This project investigates how macro news and market fundamentals influence polypropylene (PP) prices by combining time-series modelling with large language model (LLM)–based text analysis. On the market side, you work with historical price series for PP and key upstream drivers such as propylene (PGP) and crude oil, aligning everything to a clean monthly panel. On the text side, you use OPEC Monthly Oil Market Reports from 2019–2025 as a structured source of demand, supply, balance and price-outlook information. GPT-4.1 and FinBERT are applied to these reports to turn unstructured narrative into a numeric “sentiment/fundamentals index” that is comparable over time. The overarching goal is to see whether these text-derived signals can explain and predict PP price movements beyond what can be captured by crude, PGP and simple statistical baselines.

On the price and EDA layer, the project is already in a mature state. You have a robust data ingestion and cleaning pipeline that discovers price files, infers date and value columns, standardizes formats and resamples everything to monthly frequency. A first notebook performs exploratory data analysis of PP versus its drivers: normalized level charts, log-return correlations, 12-month rolling beta and R², lead–lag cross-correlations and scatter plots. This shows that PP co-moves with crude and PGP, but with time-varying strength and timing rather than a fixed one-to-one relationship. A second notebook builds forecasting baselines: naïve, seasonal-naïve, Holt-Winters and a simple regression of PP returns on lagged crude returns. These are evaluated via a rolling-origin test on recent months, producing a metrics table (MAE, RMSE, MAPE) and forecast vs actual plots. Importantly, this layer also constructs an “idiosyncratic residual” series: the component of PP returns that remains after accounting for crude (and, later, PGP) so you have a clean target for the news-based models.

On the text and sentiment side, your teammate has implemented the first half of the pipeline. All OPEC Monthly Oil Market Reports from 2019 to 2025 have been downloaded, converted from PDF to text and split into economically meaningful sections such as demand, supply, balance and price outlook. An initial sentiment pass with FinBERT provided traditional positive/negative scores but turned out to be noisy and unstable. To improve this, a second system based on GPT-4.1 compares each month’s report against the previous one, classifying whether the tone has become more bullish or bearish, section by section. The idea is to chain these relative changes over time starting from a January 2019 baseline, producing a hybrid sentiment/fundamentals index that reflects the direction and strength of OPEC’s macro signals month by month. Code and outputs for this part exist but still need to be checked and polished, especially around the baseline and chaining logic.

In terms of project stage, you are in the middle, with the foundation largely in place and the integration pieces still ahead. The market-data and EDA layer is essentially complete and already good enough to show to your professor as a self-contained story: you can explain the data sources, the PP–crude/PGP relationships, and the performance of simple statistical baselines. The OPEC text pipeline is partially implemented: data collection, sectioning, FinBERT scoring and GPT-based relative sentiment are done, but the sentiment index still needs to be finalized, saved as a reproducible monthly time series and merged with the PP residuals. The prediction layer that combines both worlds is just starting: you still have to fit and evaluate models where PP returns or PP residuals are regressed on the sentiment index and its lags, run rolling-origin tests to see whether sentiment improves forecast error over the existing baselines, and design some targeted event-study style analyses around major macro moves.

Going forward, the remaining milestones are clear. First, finish and document the sentiment index: make sure the baseline and cumulative logic are correct, export a clean monthly sentiment panel by section and in aggregate, and add a small EDA pass showing how this index behaves over time. Second, integrate sentiment with the price layer: align monthly dates, run simple regressions and small forecasting models for PP returns and residuals using sentiment (and possibly interactions with crude/PGP), and compare their out-of-sample performance to your current baselines. Third, refine the story around PGP and the full feedstock chain so you can quantify how much each driver (crude, PGP, macro sentiment) contributes to PP movements. Finally, polish documentation and presentation: a short written overview, clear notebook annotations, and a results summary that explains what you gain from adding LLM-based news analysis on top of traditional time-series models.
